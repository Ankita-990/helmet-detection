# helmet-detection
Due to the increasing number of accidents caused by two-wheeler riders not following traffic rules, it has become a serious concern. To address this issue, a Helmet Detection System has been developed using the YOLO model with OpenCV. This system helps track individuals who violate safety regulations by detecting those riding without helmets.
